## Setup

### Project Configuration

1. Enable the **WeatherKit** capability in Xcode (adds the entitlement)
2. Enable WeatherKit for your App ID in the Apple Developer portal
3. Add `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` to Info.plist if using device location
4. WeatherKit requires an active Apple Developer Program membership

### Import

```swift
import WeatherKit
import CoreLocation
```

### Creating the Service

Use the shared singleton or create an instance. `WeatherService` conforms to
`Sendable`; keep app cache and UI state isolated separately.

```swift
let weatherService = WeatherService.shared
// or
let weatherService = WeatherService()
```

## Fetching Current Weather

Fetch current conditions for a location. Returns a `Weather` object with all
available datasets.

WeatherKit temperatures are `Measurement<UnitTemperature>` values; display them
with `.formatted()` so units and number formatting follow the user's locale.

```swift
func fetchCurrentWeather(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> CurrentWeather {
    let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location)
    return weather.currentWeather
}

// Using the result
func displayCurrent(_ current: CurrentWeather) {
    let temp = current.temperature  // Measurement<UnitTemperature>
    let condition = current.condition  // WeatherCondition enum
    let symbol = current.symbolName  // SF Symbol name
    let humidity = current.humidity  // Double (0-1)
    let wind = current.wind  // Wind (speed, direction, gust)
    let uvIndex = current.uvIndex  // UVIndex

    print("\(condition): \(temp.formatted())")
}
```

## Forecasts

### Hourly Forecast

Returns 25 contiguous hours starting from the current hour by default.

```swift
func fetchHourlyForecast(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> Forecast<HourWeather> {
    let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location)
    return weather.hourlyForecast
}

// Iterate hours
for hour in hourlyForecast {
    print("\(hour.date): \(hour.temperature.formatted()), \(hour.condition)")
}
```

### Daily Forecast

Returns 10 contiguous days starting from the current day by default.

```swift
func fetchDailyForecast(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> Forecast<DayWeather> {
    let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location)
    return weather.dailyForecast
}

// Iterate days
for day in dailyForecast {
    print("\(day.date): \(day.lowTemperature.formatted()) - \(day.highTemperature.formatted())")
    print("  Condition: \(day.condition), Precipitation: \(day.precipitationChance)")
}
```

### Custom Date Range

Request forecasts for specific date ranges using `WeatherQuery`.

Daily and hourly date-range queries use an inclusive `startDate` and exclusive
`endDate`. They can include historical data from August 1, 2021. Forecasts are
available up to 10 days in the future; each request returns at most 10 daily
forecast days or about 240 hourly forecast hours.

```swift
func fetchExtendedForecast(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> Forecast<DayWeather> {
    let startDate = Date.now
    let endDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: 10, to: startDate)!

    let forecast = try await weatherService.weather(
        for: location,
        including: .daily(startDate: startDate, endDate: endDate)
    )
    return forecast
}
```

For tomorrow-specific guidance, request the local tomorrow day interval rather
than using minute forecasts:

```swift
func fetchTomorrowForecast(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> Forecast<DayWeather> {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let tomorrow = calendar.startOfDay(
        for: calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: .now)!
    )
    let dayAfterTomorrow = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: tomorrow)!

    return try await weatherService.weather(
        for: location,
        including: .daily(startDate: tomorrow, endDate: dayAfterTomorrow)
    )
}
```

## Weather Alerts

Fetch active weather alerts for a location. Alerts include severity, summary,
and affected regions.

```swift
func fetchAlerts(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> [WeatherAlert]? {
    let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location)
    return weather.weatherAlerts
}

// Process alerts
if let alerts = weatherAlerts {
    for alert in alerts {
        print("Alert: \(alert.summary)")
        print("Severity: \(alert.severity)")
        print("Region: \(alert.region ?? "Unknown region")")
        print("Details: \(alert.detailsURL)") // Non-optional and required for attribution
    }
}
```

For alert dashboards, name `WeatherAvailability` explicitly when discussing
support checks: it exposes `alertAvailability` and `minuteAvailability` only,
not a broad availability matrix for current, hourly, or daily weather.

## Selective Queries

Fetch only the datasets you need to minimize API usage and response size. Each
`WeatherQuery` type maps to one dataset.

### Single Dataset

```swift
let current = try await weatherService.weather(
    for: location,
    including: .current
)
// current is CurrentWeather
```

### Multiple Datasets

```swift
let (current, hourly, daily) = try await weatherService.weather(
    for: location,
    including: .current, .hourly, .daily
)
// current: CurrentWeather, hourly: Forecast<HourWeather>, daily: Forecast<DayWeather>
```

### Minute Forecast

Available in limited regions. Returns precipitation forecasts at minute
granularity for the next hour.

```swift
let minuteForecast = try await weatherService.weather(
    for: location,
    including: .minute
)
// minuteForecast: Forecast<MinuteWeather>?  (nil if unavailable)
```

### Available Query Types

| Query | Return Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.current` | `CurrentWeather` | Current observed conditions |
| `.hourly` | `Forecast<HourWeather>` | 25 hours from current hour |
| `.daily` | `Forecast<DayWeather>` | 10 days from today |
| `.minute` | `Forecast<MinuteWeather>?` | Next-hour precipitation (limited regions) |
| `.alerts` | `[WeatherAlert]?` | Active weather alerts |
| `.availability` | `WeatherAvailability` | Alert and minute forecast availability only |
| `.changes` | `WeatherChanges?` | Significant upcoming weather changes (iOS 18+) |
| `.historicalComparisons` | `HistoricalComparisons?` | Current weather compared to historical averages (iOS 18+) |

### Dashboard Review Checklist

For a current-temperature and alert dashboard review, explicitly cover:
- Selective `.current, .alerts` queries instead of `weather(for:)` for every dataset
- No unconditional `onAppear`/`.task` network fetch; use model or cache `loadIfNeeded`
- `WeatherMetadata.expirationDate` cache freshness
- `WeatherService.shared.attribution`, mark URLs, and `legalPageURL` beside weather data
- Optional `alert.region`, non-optional `alert.detailsURL`, and alert detail links
- `WeatherAvailability` only for `alertAvailability` and `minuteAvailability`
- `Measurement<UnitTemperature>.formatted()` for displayed temperatures
- WeatherKit capability/App ID setup and location permission when using device location

## Context Queries

Use the iOS 18+ context queries when the app needs to explain why today's
weather matters, not just display raw forecast values. Both query results are
optional.

For "unusual tomorrow" or "what is changing?" features, request both `.changes`
and `.historicalComparisons`. Use `.changes` for significant upcoming changes,
then use `.historicalComparisons` to explain how current or forecast conditions
compare with historical averages.

```swift
let (changes, comparisons) = try await weatherService.weather(
    for: location,
    including: .changes, .historicalComparisons
)
```

For historical statistics, use the `WeatherService` statistics and summary
methods rather than `WeatherQuery`. In variadic `including:` calls, state that
tuple result order matches the query argument order. Load
`references/weatherkit-patterns.md` when implementing daily summaries, daily
statistics, hourly statistics, or monthly statistics.
Use statistics properties such as `averagePrecipitationProbability`, not
forecast-only `DayWeather.precipitationChance`, in statistics examples.

## Attribution

Apple requires apps using WeatherKit to display attribution. This is a
legal requirement.

### Fetching Attribution

```swift
func fetchAttribution() async throws -> WeatherAttribution {
    return try await weatherService.attribution
}
```

### Displaying Attribution in SwiftUI

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WeatherKit

struct WeatherAttributionView: View {
    let attribution: WeatherAttribution
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Display the Apple Weather mark
            AsyncImage(url: markURL) { image in
                image
                    .resizable()
                    .scaledToFit()
                    .frame(height: 20)
            } placeholder: {
                EmptyView()
            }

            // Link to the legal attribution page
            Link("Weather data sources", destination: attribution.legalPageURL)
                .font(.caption2)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
        }
    }

    private var markURL: URL {
        colorScheme == .dark
            ? attribution.combinedMarkDarkURL
            : attribution.combinedMarkLightURL
    }
}
```

### Attribution Properties

| Property | Use |
|---|---|
| `combinedMarkLightURL` | Apple Weather mark for light backgrounds |
| `combinedMarkDarkURL` | Apple Weather mark for dark backgrounds |
| `squareMarkURL` | Square Apple Weather logo |
| `legalPageURL` | URL to the legal attribution web page |
| `legalAttributionText` | Text alternative when a web view is not feasible |
| `serviceName` | Weather data provider name |

## Availability

Check whether weather alerts or minute forecast data are available for a
location. `WeatherAvailability` reports only alert and minute availability;
other datasets, such as current weather, are expected to be supported for
geographic locations.

```swift
func checkAvailability(for location: CLLocation) async throws {
    let availability = try await weatherService.weather(
        for: location,
        including: .availability
    )

    // Check specific dataset availability
    if availability.alertAvailability == .available {
        // Safe to fetch alerts
    }

    if availability.minuteAvailability == .available {
        // Minute forecast available for this region
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### DON'T: Ship without Apple Weather attribution

Omitting attribution violates the WeatherKit terms of service and risks App Review
rejection.

```swift
// WRONG: Show weather data without attribution
VStack {
    Text("72F, Sunny")
}

// CORRECT: Always include attribution
VStack {
    Text("72F, Sunny")
    WeatherAttributionView(attribution: attribution)
}
```

### DON'T: Fetch all datasets when you only need current conditions

Each dataset query counts against your API quota. Fetch only what you display.

```swift
// WRONG: Fetches everything
let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location)
let temp = weather.currentWeather.temperature

// CORRECT: Fetch only current conditions
let current = try await weatherService.weather(
    for: location,
    including: .current
)
let temp = current.temperature
```

### DON'T: Ignore minute forecast unavailability

Minute forecasts return `nil` in unsupported regions. Force-unwrapping crashes.

```swift
// WRONG: Force-unwrap minute forecast
let minutes = try await weatherService.weather(for: location, including: .minute)
for m in minutes! { ... } // Crash in unsupported regions

// CORRECT: Handle nil
if let minutes = try await weatherService.weather(for: location, including: .minute) {
    for m in minutes { ... }
} else {
    // Minute forecast not available for this region
}
```

### DON'T: Forget the WeatherKit entitlement

Without the capability enabled, `WeatherService` calls throw at runtime.

```swift
// WRONG: No WeatherKit capability configured
let weather = try await weatherService.weather(for: location) // Throws

// CORRECT: Enable WeatherKit in Xcode Signing & Capabilities
// and in the Apple Developer portal for your App ID
```

### DON'T: Make repeated requests without caching

WeatherKit models include `metadata.expirationDate`. Cache responses until that
expiration instead of inventing a fixed refresh interval. Avoid unconditional
network calls from every `onAppear` or `.task`; let an `@Observable` model,
view model, or cache own `loadIfNeeded`, and reserve explicit refresh for user
refresh actions or location/query changes.

```swift
// WRONG: Fetch on every view appearance
.task {
    let weather = try? await fetchWeather()
}

// CORRECT: let the model/cache decide whether a fetch is needed
actor WeatherCache {
    private var cached: CurrentWeather?
    private var expiresAt: Date?

    func current(for location: CLLocation) async throws -> CurrentWeather {
        if let cached, let expiresAt, Date.now < expiresAt {
            return cached
        }
        let fresh = try await WeatherService.shared.weather(
            for: location, including: .current
        )
        cached = fresh
        expiresAt = fresh.metadata.expirationDate
        return fresh
    }
}
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] WeatherKit capability enabled in Xcode and Apple Developer portal
- [ ] Active Apple Developer Program membership (required for WeatherKit)
- [ ] Apple Weather attribution displayed wherever weather data appears
- [ ] Attribution mark uses correct color scheme variant (light/dark)
- [ ] Legal attribution page linked or `legalAttributionText` displayed
- [ ] Only needed `WeatherQuery` datasets fetched (not full `weather(for:)` when unnecessary)
- [ ] Minute forecast handled as optional (nil in unsupported regions)
- [ ] Weather alerts checked for nil before iteration
- [ ] Alert detail links use non-optional `detailsURL`; optional `region` is nil-safe
- [ ] Responses cached until each model's `metadata.expirationDate`
- [ ] `WeatherAvailability` used for alert/minute availability, not as a broad support matrix
- [ ] Location permission requested before passing `CLLocation` to service
- [ ] Temperature and measurements formatted with `Measurement.formatted()` for locale
