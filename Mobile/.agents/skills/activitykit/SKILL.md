description: "Implement, review, or improve Live Activities and Dynamic Island experiences in iOS apps using ActivityKit. Use when building real-time updating widgets for the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island — delivery tracking, sports scores, ride-sharing status, workout timers, media playback, or any time-sensitive information that updates in real time. Also use when working with ActivityKit, ActivityAttributes, Activity lifecycle (request/update/end), Dynamic Island layouts (compact/minimal/expanded), push-to-update Live Activities, or Lock Screen live widgets."

# ActivityKit

ActivityKit owns real-time, glanceable Live Activities displayed on the Lock
Screen and, on supported devices, Dynamic Island. StandBy, CarPlay, and a
paired Mac can also display Live Activities, but do not blur that core routing:
ordinary Home Screen/timeline widgets belong in `widgetkit`, and generic APNs
setup belongs in `push-notifications`. Live Activity push payload shape stays in
ActivityKit: device-token updates use `apns-push-type: liveactivity` and
`apns-topic: <bundle-id>.push-type.liveactivity`, while `aps.content-state` must
decode into the app's actual `ActivityAttributes.ContentState` `Codable` shape.
Do not assume `Date` or `ClosedRange<Date>` use Unix timestamp
`lowerBound`/`upperBound` dictionaries unless the Swift model and server
contract coordinate that encoding. Boundary answers that keep ActivityKit APNs
payloads, `content-state`, or Live Activity data contracts in scope should
include these payload-shape invariants even when routing generic APNs setup
elsewhere. Patterns target iOS 26+ with Swift 6.3;
modern `ActivityContent` lifecycle examples require iOS 16.2+ unless noted.

See [references/activitykit-patterns.md](references/activitykit-patterns.md) for complete code patterns including push payload formats, concurrent activities, state observation, and testing.

## Workflow

### 1. Create a new Live Activity

1. Add `NSSupportsLiveActivities = YES` to the host app's Info.plist.
2. Define an `ActivityAttributes` struct with a nested `ContentState`.
3. Create an `ActivityConfiguration` in the widget bundle with Lock Screen
   content and Dynamic Island closures.
4. Start the activity with `Activity.request(attributes:content:pushType:)`.
5. Update with `activity.update(_:)` and end with `activity.end(_:dismissalPolicy:)`.
6. Forward push tokens to your server for remote updates.

### 2. Review existing Live Activity code

Run through the Review Checklist at the end of this document.

## ActivityAttributes Definition

Define both static data (immutable for the activity lifetime) and dynamic
`ContentState` (changes with each update). Keep `ContentState` small because
the entire struct is serialized on every update and push payload.

```swift
import ActivityKit

struct DeliveryAttributes: ActivityAttributes {
    // Static -- set once at activity creation, never changes
    var orderNumber: Int
    var restaurantName: String

    // Dynamic -- updated throughout the activity lifetime
    struct ContentState: Codable, Hashable {
        var driverName: String
        var estimatedDeliveryTime: ClosedRange<Date>
        var currentStep: DeliveryStep
    }
}

enum DeliveryStep: String, Codable, Hashable, CaseIterable {
    case confirmed, preparing, pickedUp, delivering, delivered

    var icon: String {
        switch self {
        case .confirmed: "checkmark.circle"
        case .preparing: "frying.pan"
        case .pickedUp: "bag.fill"
        case .delivering: "box.truck.fill"
        case .delivered: "house.fill"
        }
    }
}
```

### Stale Date

Set `staleDate` on `ActivityContent` to tell the system when content becomes outdated. The system sets `context.isStale` to `true` after this date; show fallback UI (e.g., "Updating...") in your views.

```swift
let content = ActivityContent(
    state: state,
    staleDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(300), // stale after 5 minutes
    relevanceScore: 75
)
```

## Activity Lifecycle

### Starting

Use `Activity.request` to create and display a Live Activity. Pass `.token` as
the `pushType` to enable remote updates via APNs. The `ActivityContent` request
shown here requires iOS 16.2+.

```swift
let attributes = DeliveryAttributes(orderNumber: 42, restaurantName: "Pizza Place")
let state = DeliveryAttributes.ContentState(
    driverName: "Alex",
    estimatedDeliveryTime: Date()...Date().addingTimeInterval(1800),
    currentStep: .preparing
)
let content = ActivityContent(state: state, staleDate: nil, relevanceScore: 75)

do {
    let activity = try Activity.request(
        attributes: attributes,
        content: content,
        pushType: .token
    )
    print("Started activity: \(activity.id)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to start activity: \(error)")
}
```

### Updating

Update the dynamic content state from the app. Use `AlertConfiguration` to
trigger a visible banner and sound alongside the update.

```swift
let updatedState = DeliveryAttributes.ContentState(
    driverName: "Alex",
    estimatedDeliveryTime: Date()...Date().addingTimeInterval(600),
    currentStep: .delivering
)
let updatedContent = ActivityContent(
    state: updatedState,
    staleDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(300),
    relevanceScore: 90
)

// Silent update
await activity.update(updatedContent)

// Update with an alert
await activity.update(updatedContent, alertConfiguration: AlertConfiguration(
    title: "Order Update",
    body: "Your driver is nearby!",
    sound: .default
))
```

### Ending

End the activity when the tracked event completes. Choose a dismissal policy
to control how long the ended activity lingers on the Lock Screen.

```swift
let finalState = DeliveryAttributes.ContentState(
    driverName: "Alex",
    estimatedDeliveryTime: Date()...Date(),
    currentStep: .delivered
)
let finalContent = ActivityContent(state: finalState, staleDate: nil, relevanceScore: 0)

// System decides when to remove (up to 4 hours)
await activity.end(finalContent, dismissalPolicy: .default)

// Remove immediately
await activity.end(finalContent, dismissalPolicy: .immediate)

// Remove after a specific time (max 4 hours from now)
await activity.end(finalContent, dismissalPolicy: .after(Date().addingTimeInterval(3600)))
```

Always end activities on all terminal code paths -- success, user/app
cancellation, sign-out/session stop, unrecoverable app error, and terminal server
failure. If the server says the tracked event can no longer continue or be
represented accurately, apply or send a final terminal state and end the activity
instead of leaving stale progress visible. When reviewing duration claims,
distinguish the active lifetime (up to 8 hours unless the app or user ends it
sooner), system-ended Lock Screen presence (up to 4 additional hours, for 12
hours total from start), and app-ended `.default` dismissal linger (up to 4 hours
after ending).

## Lock Screen Presentation

The Lock Screen is the primary Live Activity display surface. Every device with
iOS 16.1+ displays Live Activities here. Design this layout first, then adapt
for Dynamic Island where available.

```swift
struct DeliveryActivityWidget: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        ActivityConfiguration(for: DeliveryAttributes.self) { context in
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                Text(context.attributes.restaurantName).font(.headline)

                if context.isStale {
                    Label("Updating...", systemImage: "arrow.trianglehead.2.clockwise")
                        .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                } else {
                    Text(timerInterval: context.state.estimatedDeliveryTime, countsDown: true)
                        .monospacedDigit()
                }
            }
            .padding()
        } dynamicIsland: { context in
            DynamicIsland {
                DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.center) {
                    Text(context.attributes.restaurantName).font(.headline)
                }
                DynamicIslandExpandedRegion(.trailing) {
                    Text(timerInterval: context.state.estimatedDeliveryTime, countsDown: true)
                }
            } compactLeading: {
                Image(systemName: "box.truck.fill")
            } compactTrailing: {
                Text(timerInterval: context.state.estimatedDeliveryTime, countsDown: true)
            } minimal: {
                Image(systemName: "box.truck.fill")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Supplemental Activity Families

The Lock Screen presentation has limited vertical space. Avoid layouts taller
than roughly 160 points. On iOS 18+, use `supplementalActivityFamilies` when
you provide adaptive layouts beyond the default: `.medium` for iOS/macOS
Live Activity sizing and `.small` for watchOS Live Activity sizing.

```swift
ActivityConfiguration(for: DeliveryAttributes.self) { context in
    // Lock Screen content
} dynamicIsland: { context in
    // Dynamic Island
}
.supplementalActivityFamilies([.medium, .small])
```

## Dynamic Island

Dynamic Island presentations appear only on devices that include Dynamic Island.
Design all three modes, but treat the Lock Screen as the primary surface since
not all devices have a Dynamic Island.

### Compact (Leading + Trailing)

Used when one Live Activity occupies Dynamic Island compact space. Space is
extremely limited -- show only the most critical information.

| Region | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `compactLeading` | Icon or tiny label identifying the activity |
| `compactTrailing` | One key value (timer, score, status) |

### Minimal

Shown when multiple Live Activities compete for space. Only one activity gets
the minimal slot. Display a single icon or glyph.

### Expanded Regions

Shown when the user long-presses the Dynamic Island.

| Region | Position |
|---|---|
| `.leading` | Left of the TrueDepth camera; wraps below |
| `.trailing` | Right of the TrueDepth camera; wraps below |
| `.center` | Directly below the camera |
| `.bottom` | Below all other regions |

### Keyline Tint

Apply a subtle tint to the Dynamic Island border:

```swift
DynamicIsland { /* expanded */ }
    compactLeading: { /* ... */ }
    compactTrailing: { /* ... */ }
    minimal: { /* ... */ }
    .keylineTint(.blue)
```

## Push-to-Update

Push-to-update sends Live Activity updates through APNs, which is more
efficient than polling from the app and works when the app is suspended, subject
to APNs delivery, priority, budget, and throttling.

### Setup

Pass `.token` as the `pushType` when starting the activity, then forward the
per-activity update token to your server. Update tokens can rotate, so observe
`activity.pushTokenUpdates` and re-register every emitted token:

```swift
let activity = try Activity.request(
    attributes: attributes,
    content: content,
    pushType: .token
)

// Observe token changes -- tokens can rotate
Task {
    for await token in activity.pushTokenUpdates {
        let tokenString = token.map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
        try await ServerAPI.shared.registerActivityToken(
            tokenString, activityID: activity.id
        )
    }
}
```

### APNs Payload Format

Send an HTTP/2 POST to APNs with these headers and JSON body:

**Required device-token HTTP headers:**
- `apns-push-type: liveactivity`
- `apns-topic: <bundle-id>.push-type.liveactivity`
- `apns-priority: 5` (lower priority) or `10` (immediate, counts against budget)

The `aps.alert` payload controls visible alert/banner/sound behavior; priority
alone does not create an alert.

**Payload body:** Put `timestamp`, `event`, and the full `content-state` inside `aps`. Use `event: "update"` for updates, `event: "end"` plus optional `dismissal-date` for ending, and `event: "start"` with `attributes-type`, `attributes`, `content-state`, and required `alert` for push-to-start. Add `stale-date`, `relevance-score`, or `alert` when appropriate.

The `content-state` JSON must decode into `ActivityAttributes.ContentState`. Use the default synthesized `Codable` key and value shape unless the Swift model declares custom `CodingKeys`; then coordinate those exact keys and value shapes server-side. Do not assume `Date` or `ClosedRange<Date>` values are Unix timestamp dictionaries unless your Swift model explicitly encodes them that way. Mismatched keys or types can prevent ActivityKit from applying the update.

### Push-to-Start

Start a Live Activity remotely without the app running (iOS 17.2+). Push-to-start tokens are ActivityKit-specific tokens from `Activity<Attributes>.pushToStartTokenUpdates`; they are distinct from ordinary app/device APNs tokens and per-activity update tokens:

```swift
Task {
    for await token in Activity<DeliveryAttributes>.pushToStartTokenUpdates {
        let tokenString = token.map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
        try await ServerAPI.shared.registerPushToStartToken(tokenString)
    }
}
```

### Frequent Push Updates

Add `NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates = YES` to Info.plist to increase
the system-managed push update budget. When cadence matters, check
`ActivityAuthorizationInfo.frequentPushesEnabled` and observe
`frequentPushEnablementUpdates`; Apple does not guarantee a fixed update rate.

## Recent Additions

### Scheduled Live Activities (iOS 26+)

Schedule a Live Activity to start at a future time. The system starts the
activity automatically without the app being in the foreground. Use for events
with known start times (sports games, flights, scheduled deliveries).

```swift
let scheduledDate = Calendar.current.date(
    from: DateComponents(year: 2026, month: 3, day: 15, hour: 19, minute: 0)
)!

let activity = try Activity.request(
    attributes: attributes,
    content: content,
    pushType: .token,
    style: .standard,
    alertConfiguration: AlertConfiguration(
        title: "Game Starting",
        body: "The live score is ready.",
        sound: .default
    ),
    start: scheduledDate
)
```

### ActivityStyle (iOS 18+ request parameter)

Use the iOS 18+ `style:` request parameter to choose persistence behavior. Use
`.standard` for persistent Live Activities such as deliveries, rides, sports
scores, timers, and flight/status boards. Use `.transient` only for a
short-lived expanded Dynamic Island presentation; it can auto-end when the user
locks the device, collapses or shrinks the expanded presentation, leaves the
app, or does other work outside Dynamic Island.

```swift
let activity = try Activity.request(
    attributes: attributes,
    content: content,
    pushType: .token,
    style: .standard
)
```

### Paired Mac & CarPlay (iOS 26+)

Live Activities can appear on a paired Mac and on the CarPlay Home Screen. No additional ActivityKit API is required, but validate compact layouts; buttons and toggles in Live Activities do not perform actions in CarPlay.

### Channel-Based Push (iOS 18+)

Broadcast updates to many Live Activities at once with an APNs-created channel
ID. Enable the broadcast capability outside Xcode, create the channel on the
server, then subscribe with `.channel(channelID)`. Channel pushes update or end
Live Activities; they do not start them. Use `apns-channel-id` and expiration
for channel pushes instead of the device-token `apns-topic` example above.

```swift
let activity = try Activity.request(
    attributes: attributes, content: content,
    pushType: .channel(channelIDFromServer)
)
```

## Common Mistakes

**DON'T:** Put too much content in the compact presentation -- it is tiny.
**DO:** Show only the most critical info (icon + one value) in compact leading/trailing.

**DON'T:** Update Live Activities too frequently from the app (drains battery).
**DO:** Use push-to-update for server-driven updates. Limit app-side updates to user actions.

**DON'T:** Forget to end the activity when the event reaches any terminal state.
**DO:** End activities on success, cancellation, sign-out, unrecoverable errors, and terminal server failures. A leaked activity frustrates users.

**DON'T:** Assume every device has Dynamic Island.
**DO:** Design for the Lock Screen as the primary surface; Dynamic Island is supplementary.

**DON'T:** Treat Lock Screen or Dynamic Island Live Activities as ordinary Home Screen/timeline widgets.
**DO:** Use ActivityKit for the Live Activity lifecycle and those display surfaces; route ordinary Home Screen/timeline widgets to `widgetkit`.

**DON'T:** Reduce Live Activity payload routing to generic `content-state` matching when the prompt involves APNs payloads.
**DO:** Include the actual `ContentState` `Codable` contract and coordinated `Date`/`ClosedRange<Date>` encoding caveat; route generic APNs auth and registration to `push-notifications`.

**DON'T:** Store sensitive information in ActivityAttributes (visible on Lock Screen).
**DO:** Keep sensitive data in the app and show only safe-to-display summaries.

**DON'T:** Forget to handle stale dates.
**DO:** Check `context.isStale` in views and show fallback UI ("Updating..." or similar).

**DON'T:** Ignore push token rotation. Tokens can change at any time.
**DO:** Use `activity.pushTokenUpdates` async sequence and re-register on every emission.

**DON'T:** Forget the `NSSupportsLiveActivities` Info.plist key.
**DO:** Add `NSSupportsLiveActivities = YES` to the host app's Info.plist (not the extension).

**DON'T:** Use the deprecated `contentState`-based API for request/update/end.
**DO:** Use `ActivityContent` for all lifecycle calls.

**DON'T:** Fetch network data or location directly from Live Activity views.
**DO:** Pre-compute display values in the app or server and pass them through ActivityKit updates or pushes.
