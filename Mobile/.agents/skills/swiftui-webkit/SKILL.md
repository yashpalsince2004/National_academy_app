# SwiftUI WebKit

Embed and manage web content in SwiftUI using the native WebKit-for-SwiftUI APIs introduced for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26. Use this skill when the app needs an integrated web surface, app-owned HTML content, JavaScript-backed page interaction, or custom navigation policy control.

## Choose the Right Web Container

Use the narrowest tool that matches the job.

| Need | Default choice |
|---|---|
| Embedded app-owned web content in SwiftUI | `WebView` + `WebPage` |
| iOS/iPadOS modal browsing with Safari behavior | `SFSafariViewController` |
| macOS or visionOS browse-out behavior | `openURL` / default browser |
| OAuth or third-party sign-in | `ASWebAuthenticationSession` |
| Back-deploy below iOS 26 or use missing legacy-only WebKit features | `WKWebView` fallback |

Prefer `WebView` and `WebPage` for modern SwiftUI apps targeting iOS 26+ when the new API surface covers the feature. Apple’s WWDC25 guidance frames existing UIKit/AppKit WebKit wrappers in SwiftUI apps as good candidates to try migrating, not as a blanket mandate to delete every fallback.

Do not use embedded web views for OAuth. That stays an `ASWebAuthenticationSession` flow.

## Displaying Web Content

Use the simple `WebView(url:)` form when the app only needs to render a URL and SwiftUI state drives navigation.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WebKit

struct ArticleView: View {
    let url: URL

    var body: some View {
        WebView(url: url)
    }
}
```

Create a `WebPage` when the app needs to load requests directly, observe state, call JavaScript, or customize navigation behavior.

A `WebPage` can be associated with only one `WebView` at a time. Create separate `WebPage` instances for multiple visible web views.

```swift
@Observable
@MainActor
final class ArticleModel {
    let page = WebPage()

    func load(_ url: URL) async throws {
        for try await _ in page.load(URLRequest(url: url)) {
        }
    }
}

struct ArticleDetailView: View {
    @State private var model = ArticleModel()
    let url: URL

    var body: some View {
        WebView(model.page)
            .task {
                try? await model.load(url)
            }
    }
}
```

See [references/loading-and-observation.md](references/loading-and-observation.md) for full examples.

## Loading and Observing with WebPage

`WebPage` is an `@MainActor` observable type. Use it when you need page state in SwiftUI.

Common loading entry points:
- `load(URLRequest)`
- `load(URL)`
- `load(html:baseURL:)`
- `load(_:mimeType:characterEncoding:baseURL:)`

Common observable properties:
- `title`
- `url`
- `isLoading`
- `estimatedProgress`
- `currentNavigationEvent`
- `backForwardList`

```swift
struct ReaderView: View {
    @State private var page = WebPage()

    var body: some View {
        WebView(page)
            .navigationTitle(page.title ?? "Loading")
            .overlay {
                if page.isLoading {
                    ProgressView(value: page.estimatedProgress)
                }
            }
            .task {
                do {
                    for try await _ in page.load(URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://example.com")!)) {
                    }
                } catch {
                    // Handle load failure.
                }
            }
    }
}
```

When you need to react to every navigation, observe the navigation sequence rather than only checking a single property.

```swift
Task {
    do {
        for try await event in page.navigations {
            // Handle started, redirect, committed, or finished events.
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle WebPage.NavigationError or cancellation.
    }
}
```

See [references/loading-and-observation.md](references/loading-and-observation.md) for stronger patterns and the load-sequence examples.

## Navigation Policies

Use `WebPage.NavigationDeciding` to allow, cancel, or customize navigations based on the request or response.

Typical uses:
- keep app-owned domains inside the embedded web view
- cancel external domains and hand them off with `openURL`
- intercept special callback URLs
- tune `NavigationPreferences`

```swift
@MainActor
final class ArticleNavigationDecider: WebPage.NavigationDeciding {
    var urlToOpenExternally: URL?

    func decidePolicy(
        for action: WebPage.NavigationAction,
        preferences: inout WebPage.NavigationPreferences
    ) async -> WKNavigationActionPolicy {
        guard let url = action.request.url else { return .allow }

        if url.host == "example.com" {
            return .allow
        }

        urlToOpenExternally = url
        return .cancel
    }
}
```

Keep app-level deep-link routing in the navigation skill. This skill owns navigation that happens inside embedded web content.

See [references/navigation-and-javascript.md](references/navigation-and-javascript.md) for complete patterns.

## JavaScript Integration

Use `callJavaScript(_:arguments:in:contentWorld:)` to evaluate JavaScript functions against the page.

Pass a JavaScript function body, not a wrapped function declaration or call expression. Prefer `arguments` for Swift-provided values instead of interpolating untrusted strings into the script.

```swift
let script = """
const headings = [...document.querySelectorAll('h1, h2')];
return headings.map(node => ({
    id: node.id,
    text: node.textContent?.trim()
}));
"""

let result = try await page.callJavaScript(script)
let headings = result as? [[String: Any]] ?? []
```

You can pass values through the `arguments` dictionary and cast the returned `Any` into the Swift type you actually need.

```swift
let result = try await page.callJavaScript(
    "return document.getElementById(sectionID)?.getBoundingClientRect().top ?? null;",
    arguments: ["sectionID": selectedSectionID]
)
```

Handle empty and JavaScript `null` results deliberately: no explicit return produces `nil`, while an explicit JavaScript `null` returns `NSNull`.

Important boundary: the native SwiftUI WebKit API clearly supports Swift-to-JavaScript calls, but it does not expose an obvious direct replacement for `WKScriptMessageHandler`. If you need coarse JS-to-native signaling, a custom navigation or callback-URL pattern can work, but document it as a workaround pattern, not a guaranteed one-to-one replacement.

See [references/navigation-and-javascript.md](references/navigation-and-javascript.md).

## Local Content and Custom URL Schemes

Use `WebPage.Configuration` and `URLSchemeHandler` when the app needs bundled HTML, offline documents, or app-provided resources under a custom scheme.

```swift
var configuration = WebPage.Configuration()
configuration.urlSchemeHandlers[URLScheme("docs")!] = DocsSchemeHandler(bundle: .main)

let page = WebPage(configuration: configuration)
for try await _ in page.load(URL(string: "docs://article/welcome")!) {
}

```

Use this for:
- bundled documentation or article content
- offline HTML/CSS/JS assets
- app-owned resource loading under a custom scheme

Do not overuse custom schemes for normal remote content. Prefer standard HTTPS for server-hosted pages.

See [references/local-content-and-custom-schemes.md](references/local-content-and-custom-schemes.md).

## WebView Customization

Use WebView modifiers to match the intended browsing experience.

Useful modifiers and related APIs:
- `webViewBackForwardNavigationGestures(_:)`
- `findNavigator(isPresented:)`
- `webViewScrollPosition(_:)`
- `webViewOnScrollGeometryChange(...)`

Apply them only when the user experience needs them.

- Enable back/forward gestures when people are likely to visit multiple pages.
- Add Find in Page when the content is document-like.
- Sync scroll position only when the app has a sidebar, table of contents, or other explicit navigation affordance.

Apple’s HIG also applies here: support back/forward navigation when appropriate, but do not turn an app web view into a general-purpose browser.

## Common Mistakes

- Using `WKWebView` wrappers by default in an iOS 26+ SwiftUI app instead of starting with `WebView` and `WebPage`
- Using embedded web views for OAuth instead of `ASWebAuthenticationSession`
- Reaching for `WebPage` only after building a plain `WebView(url:)` path that now needs state, JS, or navigation control
- Treating `callJavaScript` as a direct replacement for `WKScriptMessageHandler`
- Passing a callable JavaScript wrapper to `callJavaScript` instead of only the function body
- Iterating `page.navigations` without `try`/`catch` even though navigation failure terminates the sequence by throwing
- Binding the same `WebPage` to multiple visible `WebView` values
- Keeping all links inside the app when external domains should open outside the embedded surface
- Treating `SFSafariViewController` as the cross-platform browse-out answer on macOS or visionOS instead of using default-browser/openURL behavior
- Building a browser-style app shell around WebView instead of a focused embedded experience
- Using custom URL schemes for content that should just load over HTTPS
- Forgetting that `WebPage` is main-actor-isolated

## Review Checklist

- [ ] `WebView` and `WebPage` are the default path for iOS 26+ SwiftUI web content
- [ ] `ASWebAuthenticationSession` is used for auth flows instead of embedded web views
- [ ] `WebPage` is used whenever the app needs state observation, JS calls, or policy control
- [ ] Navigation policies only intercept the URLs the app actually owns or needs to reroute
- [ ] External domains open externally when appropriate
- [ ] JavaScript return values are cast defensively to concrete Swift types
- [ ] `callJavaScript` uses a function body and passes Swift values through `arguments`
- [ ] `page.navigations` loops use `for try await` and handle thrown navigation errors
- [ ] Each visible `WebView(page)` owns a distinct `WebPage`
- [ ] Custom URL schemes are used only for real app-owned resources
- [ ] Back/forward gestures or controls are enabled when multi-page browsing is expected
- [ ] `SFSafariViewController` is limited to iOS/iPadOS Safari-style modal browsing; macOS and visionOS browse-out flows use platform default browser behavior
- [ ] The web experience adds focused native value instead of behaving like a thin browser shell
- [ ] Fallback to `WKWebView` is justified by deployment target or missing API needs
