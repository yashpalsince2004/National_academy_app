## Core Principles

1. Every interactive element MUST have an accessible label. If no visible text exists, add `.accessibilityLabel`.
2. Every custom control MUST have correct traits via `.accessibilityAddTraits` (never direct assignment). For binary custom controls such as favorite/star buttons, prefer a real `Toggle`; otherwise expose toggle behavior with `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isToggle)` and a current state value without putting the control type in the label.
3. Custom adjustable controls such as quantity steppers MUST expose adjustable behavior with `.accessibilityAdjustableAction`; UIKit custom adjustable controls also need the `.adjustable` trait.
4. Decorative images MUST be hidden from assistive technologies.
5. Sheet and dialog dismissals MUST return VoiceOver focus to the trigger element.
6. All tap targets MUST be at least 44x44 points.
7. Dynamic Type MUST be supported everywhere (system fonts, `@ScaledMetric`, adaptive layouts).
8. No information conveyed by color alone -- always provide text or icon alternatives.
9. System accessibility preferences MUST be respected: Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency, Bold Text, Increase Contrast.

## How VoiceOver Reads Elements

VoiceOver reads element properties in a fixed, non-configurable order:

**Label -> Value -> Trait -> Hint**

Design your labels, values, and hints with this reading order in mind.

## SwiftUI Accessibility Modifiers

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for detailed SwiftUI modifier examples (labels, hints, traits, grouping, custom controls, adjustable actions, and custom actions).

## Focus Management

Focus management is where most apps fail. When a sheet, alert, or popover is dismissed, VoiceOver focus MUST return to the element that triggered it.

This section is about accessibility focus for assistive technologies. For keyboard focus, directional focus, `focusSection()`, scene-focused values, and `UIFocusGuide`, use the `focus-engine` skill.

When triaging broad focus bugs, still call out accessibility traversal separately: accessibility element order and grouping in the view hierarchy directly affect VoiceOver swipe order, Switch Control scan order, Voice Control overlay targeting, and Full Keyboard Access reachability review. Route keyboard-focus implementation to `focus-engine`, but keep this traversal impact in `ios-accessibility`.

### `@AccessibilityFocusState` (iOS 15+)

`@AccessibilityFocusState` is a property wrapper that reads and writes the current accessibility focus. It works with `Bool` for single-target focus or an optional `Hashable` enum for multi-target focus.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSheet = false
    @AccessibilityFocusState private var focusOnTrigger: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button("Open Settings") { showSheet = true }
            .accessibilityFocused($focusOnTrigger)
            .sheet(isPresented: $showSheet) {
                SettingsSheet()
                    .onDisappear {
                        // Slight delay allows the transition to complete before moving focus
                        Task { @MainActor in
                            try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(100))
                            focusOnTrigger = true
                        }
                    }
            }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Target Focus with Enum

```swift
enum A11yFocus: Hashable {
    case nameField
    case emailField
    case submitButton
}

struct FormView: View {
    @AccessibilityFocusState private var focus: A11yFocus?

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Name", text: $name)
                .accessibilityFocused($focus, equals: .nameField)
            TextField("Email", text: $email)
                .accessibilityFocused($focus, equals: .emailField)
            Button("Submit") { validate() }
                .accessibilityFocused($focus, equals: .submitButton)
        }
    }

    func validate() {
        if name.isEmpty {
            focus = .nameField // Move VoiceOver to the invalid field
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Modals

Custom overlay views need the `.isModal` trait to trap VoiceOver focus and an escape action for dismissal:

```swift
CustomDialog()
    .accessibilityAddTraits(.isModal)
    .accessibilityAction(.escape) { dismiss() }
```

Test dismissal as part of the modal contract: users must be able to dismiss the overlay with the relevant assistive-technology escape gesture or keyboard escape path, and focus should return to the trigger or next logical target.

### Accessibility Notifications (UIKit)

When you need to announce changes or move focus imperatively in UIKit contexts:

```swift
// Announce a status change (e.g., "Item deleted", "Upload complete")
UIAccessibility.post(notification: .announcement, argument: "Upload complete")

// Partial screen update -- move focus to a specific element
UIAccessibility.post(notification: .layoutChanged, argument: targetView)

// Full screen transition -- move focus to the new screen
UIAccessibility.post(notification: .screenChanged, argument: newScreenView)
```

## Dynamic Type

Scale text with system text styles. Scale non-text dimensions too: icon sizes, spacing, control heights, and custom hit-region dimensions should use `@ScaledMetric(relativeTo:)` where they need to track text size.

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for Dynamic Type and adaptive layout examples, including `@ScaledMetric` and minimum tap target patterns.

## Custom Rotors

Rotors let VoiceOver users quickly navigate to specific content types. Add custom rotors for content-heavy screens. See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for complete rotor examples.

## System Accessibility Preferences

Always respect these environment values:

```swift
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceTransparency) var reduceTransparency
@Environment(\.colorSchemeContrast) var contrast         // .standard or .increased
@Environment(\.legibilityWeight) var legibilityWeight    // .regular or .bold
```

### Reduce Motion

Replace movement-based animations with crossfades or no animation:

```swift
withAnimation(reduceMotion ? nil : .spring()) {
    showContent.toggle()
}
content.transition(reduceMotion ? .opacity : .slide)
```

Review every moving transition, including row deletion, quantity changes, sheet or checkout presentation, and modal dismissal. Under Reduce Motion, replace slide, bounce, parallax, spring, and large spatial transitions with opacity changes, instant state changes, or no animation.

### Reduce Transparency, Increase Contrast, Bold Text

```swift
// Solid backgrounds when transparency is reduced
.background(reduceTransparency ? Color(.systemBackground) : Color(.systemBackground).opacity(0.85))

// Stronger colors when contrast is increased
.foregroundStyle(contrast == .increased ? .primary : .secondary)

// Bold weight when system bold text is enabled
.fontWeight(legibilityWeight == .bold ? .bold : .regular)
```

## Decorative Content

```swift
// Decorative images: hidden from VoiceOver
Image(decorative: "background-pattern")
Image("visual-divider").accessibilityHidden(true)

// Icon next to text: Label handles this automatically
Label("Settings", systemImage: "gear")

// Icon-only buttons: MUST have an accessibility label
Button(action: { }) {
    Image(systemName: "gear")
}
.accessibilityLabel("Settings")
```

Treat an image as decorative only when it adds no information beyond adjacent accessible text. If it communicates a product variant, state, chart point, user-generated content, or another distinguishing detail, provide a meaningful description instead of hiding it.

## Voice Control

Voice Control relies on accessibility labels to generate spoken tap targets. If a label is missing or unspeakable, Voice Control cannot target the element.

- Every interactive element MUST have a speakable accessibility label (no emoji-only, no symbol-only).
- Labels must be unique within the visible screen — duplicate labels force users to disambiguate with overlay numbers.
- Treat `accessibilityInputLabels` as pre-freeze accessibility work for long, awkward, localized, acronym-heavy, or commonly shortened spoken labels; do not defer it as polish. Voice Control and Full Keyboard Access use these. List alternatives in descending order of importance.
- Apply `accessibilityInputLabels` broadly to any visible target whose primary label is hard to say, including repeated row actions, quantity controls, account/settings links, media controls, and localized labels with acronyms or product names.
- Test with Voice Control enabled: say "Show Names" and "Show Numbers" to verify all interactive elements are targetable.
- For Voice Control reviews, verify both overlays: "Show Names" confirms speakable labels, and "Show Numbers" confirms every visible interactive target can still be reached when names are missing, duplicated, or awkward.

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for `accessibilityInputLabels` examples and speakable label guidelines.

## Switch Control

Switch Control scans accessibility elements sequentially in reading order. Proper grouping and custom actions are critical for usability.

- Group related content with `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to reduce scan stops.
- Every scan target should be meaningful and actionable. Decorative elements hidden from VoiceOver are also hidden from Switch Control.
- Switch Control users cannot perform swipe-to-delete, long-press, or multi-finger gestures. Expose these interactions as `.accessibilityAction(named:)` custom actions instead — Switch Control presents them as a menu.
- Custom controls with non-standard hit areas should ensure `accessibilityFrame` accurately reflects the tappable region (for point scanning mode).

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for custom action and grouping examples.

## Full Keyboard Access

Full Keyboard Access (iOS/iPadOS 13.4+) lets users navigate and operate an app with a hardware keyboard.

This skill covers the accessibility review surface: whether all controls are reachable, clearly labeled, visibly focused, and operable without touch. If the bug is Tab traversal, skipped custom cards, `.focusable()`, `@FocusState`, `focusSection()`, directional movement, scene-focused values, tvOS focus behavior, or `UIFocusGuide`, route implementation to the `focus-engine` skill first. Keep only the accessibility finding here.

- Every interactive element can be reached and activated with the keyboard.
- Traversal order is logical and does not trap focus.
- Focus indicators remain visible at all contrast and text-size settings.
- Gesture-only behavior has a keyboard-operable alternative.
- App shortcuts do not override system-defined shortcuts such as Cmd+C, Cmd+V, or Cmd+Tab.

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for Full Keyboard Access audit checks.

## Traversal Order

Explicitly assess how accessibility element order and grouping affect traversal outcomes: VoiceOver swipe order, Switch Control scan order, Voice Control overlay targeting, and Full Keyboard Access reachability review can all break when grouping/order differs from visual or task order. Missing labels, duplicate labels, excessive row children, hidden custom controls, or grouping that does not match the visual/task order can make traversal confusing across all of them. Keep implementation mechanics for keyboard or directional routing in `focus-engine`; keep the accessibility impact and ordering audit here.

## Assistive Access (iOS 18+)

Assistive Access provides a simplified interface for users with cognitive disabilities. Apps should support this mode:

```swift
// Check if Assistive Access is active (iOS 18+)
@Environment(\.accessibilityAssistiveAccessEnabled) var isAssistiveAccessEnabled

var body: some View {
    if isAssistiveAccessEnabled {
        SimplifiedContentView()
    } else {
        FullContentView()
    }
}
```

Key guidelines:
- Reduce visual complexity: fewer controls, larger tap targets, simpler navigation
- Use clear, literal language for labels and instructions
- Minimize the number of choices presented at once
- Test with Assistive Access enabled in Settings > Accessibility > Assistive Access

## UIKit Accessibility Patterns

When working with UIKit views:

- Set `isAccessibilityElement = true` on meaningful custom views.
- Set `accessibilityLabel` on all interactive elements without visible text.
- Use `.insert()` and `.remove()` for trait modification (not direct assignment).
- Set `accessibilityViewIsModal = true` on custom overlay views to trap focus.
- Post `.announcement` for transient status messages.
- Post `.layoutChanged` with a target view for partial screen updates.
- Post `.screenChanged` for full screen transitions.

```swift
// UIKit trait modification
customButton.accessibilityTraits.insert(.button)
customButton.accessibilityTraits.remove(.staticText)

// Modal overlay
overlayView.accessibilityViewIsModal = true
```

## AppKit Accessibility Patterns

AppKit accessibility uses `NSAccessibilityProtocol` and related role-specific protocols to describe accessible elements. Standard AppKit controls already provide much of this behavior; customize labels, values, roles, and actions only when the defaults are insufficient.

- Prefer standard AppKit controls first — they already expose accessibility metadata and notifications.
- For custom `NSView` subclasses, adopt the appropriate role-specific accessibility behavior and return the correct role, label, value, and actions.
- Use `NSAccessibilityElement` for accessible items that are not backed by their own `NSView`.
- Post `NSAccessibility` notifications when state changes need to be announced to assistive apps.

```swift
final class FavoriteToggleView: NSView {
    var isFavorite = false {
        didSet {
            NSAccessibility.post(element: self, notification: .valueChanged)
        }
    }

    override func isAccessibilityElement() -> Bool { true }
    override func accessibilityRole() -> NSAccessibility.Role? { .button }
    override func accessibilityLabel() -> String? { "Favorite" }
    override func accessibilityValue() -> Any? { isFavorite ? "On" : "Off" }

    override func accessibilityPerformPress() -> Bool {
        isFavorite.toggle()
        return true
    }
}
```

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for AppKit examples including `NSAccessibilityElement` and announcement notifications.

## Accessibility Custom Content

See [references/a11y-patterns.md](references/a11y-patterns.md) for UIKit and AppKit accessibility patterns and custom content examples.

```swift
ProductRow(product: product)
    .accessibilityCustomContent("Price", product.formattedPrice)
    .accessibilityCustomContent("Rating", "\(product.rating) out of 5")
    .accessibilityCustomContent(
        "Availability",
        product.inStock ? "In stock" : "Out of stock",
        importance: .high  // .high reads automatically with the element
    )
```

## App Store Accessibility Nutrition Labels

For App Store accessibility nutrition labels, product-page claims, or App Store Connect accessibility answers, read [references/nutrition-labels.md](references/nutrition-labels.md).

Before recommending a claim, require evidence that users can complete all common tasks with that feature on the relevant device type. Use a structured common-task by accessibility-feature matrix, include media transcripts when captions for audio-only content are relevant, and explicitly warn that App Store accessibility answers must stay accurate and must not be treated as marketing claims.

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing

- **Accessibility Inspector** (Xcode > Open Developer Tool): Audit views for missing labels, traits, and contrast issues. Run audits against the Simulator or connected device.
- **VoiceOver testing**: Enable in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver. Navigate every screen with swipe gestures.
- **Voice Control testing**: Enable in Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control. Say both "Show Names" and "Show Numbers"; names verify speakable labels, while numbers verify every visible interactive target is reachable even when names are duplicated, missing, or awkward.
- **Full Keyboard Access testing**: Enable in Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards > Full Keyboard Access. Tab through every screen and verify all interactive elements receive focus.
- **Switch Control testing**: Enable in Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control. Verify scan order is logical and custom actions appear for gesture-based interactions.
- **Dynamic Type**: Test with all text sizes in Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text.

### Automated Testing with XCTest

Use `XCUIElement` accessibility attributes to write UI tests that verify accessibility properties:

```swift
func testProductRowAccessibility() throws {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launch()

    let productCell = app.cells["product-organic-apples"]
    XCTAssertTrue(productCell.exists)
    XCTAssertTrue(productCell.isEnabled)

    // Verify the label is set and meaningful
    XCTAssertFalse(productCell.label.isEmpty)

    // Verify a specific element has the expected label
    let favoriteButton = productCell.buttons["Favorite"]
    XCTAssertTrue(favoriteButton.exists)
    XCTAssertTrue(favoriteButton.isEnabled)
}
```

Key `XCUIElementAttributes` properties for accessibility verification: `label`, `identifier`, `value`, `isEnabled`, `hasFocus`, `isSelected`, `placeholderValue`, `title`.

Test dismissal focus restoration:

```swift
func testSheetDismissReturnsFocus() throws {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launch()

    let triggerButton = app.buttons["Open Settings"]
    triggerButton.tap()

    // Dismiss the sheet
    let doneButton = app.buttons["Done"]
    doneButton.tap()

    // Verify focus returns to trigger (in accessibility-focused testing)
    XCTAssertTrue(triggerButton.hasFocus)
}
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Direct trait assignment**: UIKit trait mutation or incorrect SwiftUI trait APIs can overwrite existing behavior. In SwiftUI, use `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)`.
2. **Missing focus restoration**: Dismissing sheets without returning VoiceOver focus to the trigger element.
3. **Ungrouped list rows**: Multiple text elements per row create excessive swipe stops. Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)`.
4. **Redundant trait in labels**: `.accessibilityLabel("Settings button")` reads as "Settings button, button." Omit the type.
5. **Missing labels on icon-only buttons**: Every `Image`-only button MUST have `.accessibilityLabel`.
6. **Ignoring Reduce Motion**: Always check `accessibilityReduceMotion` before movement animations.
7. **Fixed font sizes**: `.font(.system(size: 16))` ignores Dynamic Type. Use `.font(.body)` or similar text styles.
8. **Small tap targets**: Icons without `frame(minWidth: 44, minHeight: 44)` and `.contentShape()`.
9. **Color as sole indicator**: Red/green for error/success without text or icon alternatives.
10. **Missing `.isModal` on overlays**: Custom modals without `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isModal)` let VoiceOver escape.
