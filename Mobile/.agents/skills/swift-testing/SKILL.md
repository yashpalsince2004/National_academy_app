# Swift Testing

Swift Testing is the modern testing framework for Swift (Xcode 16+, Swift 6+). Prefer it for new unit tests. Keep XCTest where migration is still in progress, and use XCTest for UI automation, performance APIs, Objective-C exception tests, and common snapshot-test tooling.

## Basic Tests

```swift
import Testing

@Test("User can update their display name")
func updateDisplayName() {
    var user = User(name: "Alice")
    user.name = "Bob"
    #expect(user.name == "Bob")
}
```

## `@Test` Traits

```swift
@Test("Validates email format")                                    // display name
@Test(.tags(.validation, .email))                                  // tags
@Test(.disabled("Server migration in progress"))                   // disabled
@Test(.enabled(if: ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["CI"] != nil)) // conditional
@Test(.bug("https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42"))               // bug reference
@Test(.timeLimit(.minutes(1)))                                     // time limit
@Test("Timeout handling", .tags(.networking), .timeLimit(.seconds(30))) // combined
```

## #expect and #require

```swift
// #expect records failure but continues execution
#expect(result == 42)
#expect(name.isEmpty == false)
#expect(items.count > 0, "Items should not be empty")

// #expect with error type checking
#expect(throws: ValidationError.self) {
    try validate(email: "not-an-email")
}

// #expect with specific error value
#expect {
    try validate(email: "")
} throws: { error in
    guard let err = error as? ValidationError else { return false }
    return err == .empty
}

// #require records failure AND stops test (like XCTUnwrap)
let user = try #require(await fetchUser(id: 1))
#expect(user.name == "Alice")

// #require for optionals -- unwraps or fails
let first = try #require(items.first)
#expect(first.isValid)
```

**Rule: Use `#require` when subsequent assertions depend on the value. Use `#expect` for independent checks.**

## `@Suite` and Test Organization

See [references/testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) for suite organization, confirmation patterns, known-issue handling, and execution-model details.

## Execution Model

Swift Testing runs tests in parallel by default. Do not assume test order, shared suite instances, or exclusive access to mutable state unless you explicitly design for it.

```swift
@Suite(.serialized)
struct KeychainTests {
    @Test func storesToken() throws { /* ... */ }
    @Test func deletesToken() throws { /* ... */ }
}
```

Use `.serialized` when a test or suite must run one-at-a-time because it touches shared external state. It does not make unrelated tests outside that scope run serially.

**Rules:**
- Each test must set up its own state.
- Shared mutable globals are a bug unless protected or intentionally serialized.
- `@Suite(.serialized)` is for exclusive execution, not for expressing logical ordering between tests.
- If tests depend on sequence, combine them into one test or move the sequence into shared helper code.

## XCTest Migration Boundaries

Swift Testing unit tests do not inherit from `XCTestCase`. Declare `@Test` on free functions, global functions, or methods on suite types such as `struct`, `class`, or `actor`; use `static` or `class` methods when instance fixtures are not needed.

When reviewing migration code or plans, do not collapse every XCTest construct into `#expect`. Include a compact assertion-mapping note or table in the answer so required unwraps and unconditional manual failures are not lost, even when the user only says "replace every XCTAssert with #expect."

State coexistence explicitly: XCTest and Swift Testing can coexist during migration. Keep UI automation, performance benchmarks, and common snapshot-test flows on XCTest/XCUITest or snapshot tooling, and separate files or targets when that makes runner expectations clearer.

For Xcode 27-era migrations, mention test framework interoperability when reviewing mixed helpers. Frame what changed: test plans created before Xcode 27 inherit `limited` mode, where cross-framework XCTest issues are warnings; new Xcode 27 projects use `complete` mode, where those issues remain errors. Xcode and SwiftPM can surface XCTest failures from Swift Testing tests and Swift Testing issues from XCTest tests depending on the configured interop mode (`limited`, `complete`, `strict`, or `none`). Prefer `complete` or `strict` while migrating helpers, use `SWIFT_TESTING_XCTEST_INTEROP_MODE` for SwiftPM when needed, and do not claim cross-framework APIs are categorically forbidden. Still prefer native Swift Testing APIs in new Swift Testing tests and convert helper failures to `Issue.record`, `#expect`, `#require`, or `Test.cancel` over time.

Migration defaults:
- `XCTAssert*` -> `#expect(...)`
- `XCTUnwrap` or any value required by later checks -> `try #require(...)`
- `XCTFail("...")` or manual unconditional issues -> `Issue.record("...")`
- UI tests, performance benchmarks, and common snapshot-test flows stay on XCTest/XCUITest or snapshot tooling.
- Put `@available` on individual `@Test` functions, not on suite types or their containing types.

```swift
let user = try #require(optionalUser)
#expect(user.isActive)

guard featureFlag.isEnabled else {
    Issue.record("Expected feature flag to be enabled")
    return
}
```

See [references/testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) for migration examples and [references/testing-advanced.md](references/testing-advanced.md) for Swift/Xcode version gates.

## Known Issues

Mark expected failures so they do not cause test failure:

```swift
withKnownIssue("Propane tank is empty") {
    #expect(truck.grill.isHeating)
}

// Intermittent / flaky failures
withKnownIssue(isIntermittent: true) {
    #expect(service.isReachable)
}

// Conditional known issue
withKnownIssue {
    #expect(foodTruck.grill.isHeating)
} when: {
    !hasPropane
}
```

If no known issues are recorded, Swift Testing records a distinct issue notifying you the problem may be resolved.

## Additional Patterns

See [references/testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) for parameterized tests, tags and suites, async testing, traits, and execution-model details.

## Test Attachments

Attach diagnostic data to test results for debugging failures. See [references/testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) for full examples.

```swift
@Test func generateReport() async throws {
    let report = try generateReport()
    Attachment.record(report.data, named: "report.json")
    #expect(report.isValid)
}
```

Image attachments require Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4 or newer. Import `Testing` plus the relevant UI framework, then record the platform image value directly:

```swift
import Testing
import UIKit

@Test func renderedChart() async throws {
    let image = renderer.image { ctx in chartView.drawHierarchy(in: bounds, afterScreenUpdates: true) }
    Attachment.record(image, named: "chart", as: .png)
}
```

## Exit Testing

Test code that calls `exit()`, `fatalError()`, or `preconditionFailure()`. Exit testing requires Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26.0 or newer and is supported on macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows runtime targets, not iOS, tvOS, or watchOS. When correcting exit-test code, name both the toolchain floor and runtime support. See [references/testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) for details.

```swift
@Test func invalidInputCausesExit() async {
    await #expect(processExitsWith: .failure) {
        processInvalidInput()  // calls fatalError()
    }
}
```

## Version-Gated APIs

For advanced Swift Testing APIs, check the toolchain before recommending them. When reviewing user code that mentions one of these APIs, name the gate for each API you correct:
- Exit testing requires Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26.0 and does not support iOS, tvOS, or watchOS runtime targets.
- Exit-test capture lists require the Swift 6.3 compiler. If an exit-test closure reads parent-process values, use an explicit capture list and state that captured values must be `Sendable` and `Codable`.
- `Test.cancel(_:)`, `Issue.record(_:severity:)`, and image attachment recording require Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4-era support as noted in [references/testing-advanced.md](references/testing-advanced.md).
- When fixing a `Test.cancel(_:)` sample, state both shape and gate: the test must be `throws` or `async throws`, and `Test.cancel(_:)` requires Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4-era support.

```swift
@Test func exitsWithCapturedCode() async {
    let expectedCode: Int32 = 42
    await #expect(processExitsWith: .failure) { [expectedCode] in
        exit(expectedCode)
    }
}
```

## Advanced API Review Checklist

When reviewing stale or beta-era Swift Testing samples, include the exact correction and the gate for every API the prompt mentions:

| User code to correct | Current guidance |
|---|---|
| `#expect(exitsWith:)` | Use `await #expect(processExitsWith: .failure) { ... }`. Exit testing requires Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26.0 or newer and is supported on macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows runtime targets, not iOS, tvOS, or watchOS. For an iOS app target, test fatal-path logic through a smaller non-exiting API or a supported host/tool target. |
| Exit-test closure reads outer values | Add an explicit capture list, for example `{ [expectedCode] in ... }`. Exit-test capture lists require the Swift 6.3 compiler; captured values must be `Sendable` and `Codable`. |
| `Test.cancel()` in a test that awaits work | Make the test `async throws` and call `try Test.cancel("reason")`. `Test.cancel(_:)` requires Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4-era support. |
| `Issue.record(..., severity: .warning)` | Use `Issue.record("message", severity: .warning)`. Warning severity is reported but does not fail the test, and requires Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4-era support. |
| `Attachment(image, named:).record()` | Use `Attachment.record(image, named: "name", as: .png)`. Import `Testing` plus the relevant image framework; Apple-platform image values include `UIImage`, `CGImage`, `CIImage`, and `NSImage`. Image attachment recording requires Swift 6.3 / Xcode 26.4-era support. |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Testing implementation, not behavior.** Test what the code does, not how.
2. **No error path tests.** If a function can throw, test the throw path.
3. **Flaky async tests.** Use `confirmation` with expected counts, not `sleep` calls.
4. **Shared mutable state between tests.** Each test sets up its own state via `init()` in `@Suite`.
5. **Missing accessibility identifiers in UI tests.** XCUITest queries rely on them.
6. **Using `sleep` in tests.** Use `confirmation`, clock injection, or `withKnownIssue`.
7. **Not testing cancellation.** If code supports `Task` cancellation, verify it cancels cleanly.
8. **Unclear XCTest migration boundaries.** Apple allows XCTest and Swift Testing in one file during migration; prefer separate files when it keeps imports, ownership, and runner expectations clearer.
9. **Non-Sendable test helpers shared across tests.** Ensure test helper types are Sendable when shared across concurrent test cases. Annotate MainActor-dependent test code with `@MainActor`.
10. **Assuming tests run in declaration order.** Swift Testing runs in parallel by default; use `.serialized` only when exclusive execution is required.
11. **Using `.serialized` to express workflow steps.** Serialized execution does not make one test feed another; keep dependent steps in one test.

## Review Checklist
